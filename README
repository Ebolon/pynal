Pynal - journaling and PDF annotation application.

Intended for use on tablets to make quick illustrations and add notes
and other annotations.

For installation instructions see docs/INSTALL

The source is published under the 2-clause BSD license. For details 
see docs/LICENSE

Notes:
The pynalui.rc contains the xml configuration for the toolbars and menus.
When the application is installed the file will be moved automatically, if
that is not the case move it to:
	$HOME/.kde4/share/apps/pynal/pynalui.rc

When done correctly the toolbar will be populated and you will see a "Wtf" menu without entries.
You might want to (hard) link this file to its location for easier updating and editing.
