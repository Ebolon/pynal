Notes:
The pynalui.rc contains the xml configuration for the toolbars and menus.
When the application is installed the file will be moved automatically, if
that is not the case move it to:
	$HOME/.kde4/share/apps/pynal/pynalui.rc

When done correctly the toolbar will be populated.

The pynalrc provides default (and more) settings for the application. Needs to be
copied to
	$HOME/.kde4/share/config/pynalrc
