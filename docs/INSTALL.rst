Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation process
====================

Pynal is distributed as python modules so there is no need
for a build process. To install the modules execute::
    python setup.py install

Pynal can then be started by executing ``pynal`` in a terminal.

To start without installing (for development) change into the src/pynal directory and execute::
python PynalStart.py
